# Vision – Virtual Engagement Analyzer

## Problem
Remote meetings and online learning have become standard, yet organizations
lack reliable data on participant engagement, attention, and sentiment.
Attendance alone does not reflect productivity or effectiveness.

into measurable, data-driven experiences.

behavioral trends, and sentiment to provide actionable insights for:
